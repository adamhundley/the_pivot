Crash At My Pad (CAMP) is an eCommerce Rails application that was built upon [Little Owl](https://github.com/weilandia/little_owl). The main goal for this project was to learn how to "pivot" an existing business model into something completely different to reflect an agile approach of a real world scenario.

### Learning Goals
- Working with Multi-tenancy
- Implementing JavaScript
- Securing a Rails App
- Sending Email
- Creating Seed files

Production is hosted [here](http://crashatmypad.herokuapp.com/).
